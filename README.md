Hi, this is my place to show my little projects. I speak Spanish and English, so my repositories will have a mix of both languages.

I'm a computer technician, and I work in the sys-admin sector. I'm interested (and learning) about cyber-security and forensic computing, however, I'm always in continuous training and looking to learn more about the topics that interest me.

Among my binary hobbies are: computer security, tinkering with the GNU/Linux environment and modifying operating system installation images. I dedicate part of my free time helping people that doesn't go well with computers.

I hope that what I share here can be useful to someone. I have planned that everything I share here should be free software, so I would greatly appreciate collaborations to help improve what I do, since it benefits not only me, but also others, now and forever.

You can contact with me on this email: [deboniet@gmail.com](mailto:deboniet@gmail.com)
